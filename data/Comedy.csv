They push back against the system, refusing to be lumped in with the masses in the heartland, adopting the mantra 'Quit your day job'. They seek a better way. Problem is, they're idiots. All they've got is a car, a dream, and a very dumb idea: let someone else rob the bank, and then rob the robbers. Theirs is a quest to plunge headlong into the Pantheon of Poor Choices. 'The only thing we have to fear is fear itself'. Some Presidents offer quotes for the ages; others, not so much. These lowered standards have become the lyrics of a troubled era. It's the soundtrack of the misguided, and the music of choice of Tom and Grant. Just as Bruce Springsteen's lyrics for 'Born in the USA' were never anthemic, Tom and Grant's, 'When You Are a Star', was never intended to inspire... Tom Cavanagh and Grant Gustin, arch rivals on the television show 'The Flash', team up to play the titular small time crooks. Their brotherhood is the fuel that drives this caper, offering dissections of the movie stakeout archetype, musings on freedom, and a truly unfortunate misinterpretation of the term 'jazz hands'.

From his unmistakable bullish frame came a scathingly ribald stand-up style that took early audiences by force. Through stark, smart observation and judo-like turns of phrase, Crimmins's rapid-fire comedy was a war on ignorance and complacency in '80s America at the height of an ill-considered foreign policy. Crimmins discusses another side of his character, revealing in detail a dark and painful past that inspired his life-changing campaign of activism in the hope of saving others from a similar experience. Interviews with comics like Margaret Cho and Marc Maron illustrate Crimmins's love affair with comedy and his role in discovering and supporting the development of many of today's stars.

All Stars,98,"""ALL-STARS"" follows a girls' 10-year-old fastpitch softball team and their families through a recreation league season that culminates in the selection of the coveted 10-and-under All-Star team. Lance Grayden, a veteran coach who left the league years ago when his daughter moved to an elite softball club team, and then college, has returned to ""give something back"" to the community. He assumed he'd be coaching a 16-and-under team of seasoned and accomplished competitors, but instead is saddled with a 10-and-under team of inexperienced players. Not only is he forced to go back to the basics and teach the fundamentals of the game to the little girls, half of whom would rather be in the dugout eating snacks, but he also faces the greater challenge of riding herd over their over-eager, overly ambitious, and entirely delusional parents whose ridiculous behavior is more suited to five-year-olds than adults. Lance also faces a personal decision about whether it's more important to win at all costs or to teach the girls something their parents seem to have forgotten: that each player is a valuable member of the team and fair play is more important than winning. Even though he knows what the answer should be, Lance's moral compass is severely tested by the relentless take-no-prisoners mentality of the parents as well as his own ambitions and innate drive to win. He may be dealing with eight, nine, and ten-year-old little girls, but he is, after all, only human. Meanwhile, each parent is on a mission to ensure that their nine-year-old prodigy is recognized as the elite athlete they imagine her to be, whether or not she possesses one whit of actual athletic ability. The parents' blind ambitions, combined with their grand delusions, give each parent the baseless notion that the Holy Grail - an All-Star jacket with their child's name on the back - is not only within reach, but is her God-given-birthright. ""All-Stars"" provides a hilarious commentary on the state of all youth sports today, fueled by the outrageous behavior of the desperate sports parent living vicariously through his or her child. In the vein of a Christopher Guest film - think ""Best in Show"" where it's more about the dog owners than the dogs - ""All-Stars"" is about the adults involved in youth sports (parents, coaches, umpires, volunteers, board members, etc.) more than the kids.",2014,Comedy            ,"Fred Willard, Miriam Flynn, Logan Kinsey, Mike Hagerty",Lance Kinsey,274,,6.5

Shooting for Socrates,91,"In November 1985, the troubled streets of Belfast are torn up by rioting yet again. In amongst the angry mob, we find nine year old Tommy, nonchalantly dribbling a ball through the insanity. Whilst politicians argue over the peace process, there's only one thing on young Tommy's football-mad mind - the forthcoming World Cup, where Northern Ireland will take on Brazil. For the South American giants it's just another step on the path to inevitable global domination, yet for Northern Ireland, and young Tommy, it's the biggest game of their lives. They are two countries that couldn't seem further apart: Northern Ireland, with its Orange men and Republican curbstones, the Rev'd Ian Paisley and Fergal Sharkey; and Brazil with its carnival, its Samba, with Pelé and the 'beautiful game'. On the football field, eccentric Northern Ireland coach Billy Bingham (they call him Mr FIFA - ""a fee for this and a fee for that"") must plug together a bunch of misfits and third divisioners. Brazil are led by none other than the philosopher-captain (Dr.) Sócrates, who has, in part, inspired the collapse of his country's ruthless military junta, and they are the hot favourites to scoop up football's ultimate prize. As bunting replaces bombs on the streets of Belfast, and Catholic and Protestants alike turn their attention to the big match, Tommy's dockworker turned philosopher father Arthur uses his son's passion for football to enlighten him on the events that make up his chaotic world. The story interweaves young Tommy's coming of age tale with the trials and travails of the hapless Northern Irish team over the nine months leading up to their ultimate game, in the stifling heat of Mexico at the world's greatest festival of football. As the hours tick down to the ultimate battle, with his lead striker crocked, Bingham is forced to place his faith in young rookie, Davey Campbell - ""the next George Best"". Back home, Tommy waits anxiously for the biggest day of his life - because the day of the match is also his tenth birthday - and his father has promised to take him to the ""top of the World"" - the massive crane at Belfast Docks where Arthur works. From here he can see the whole of his world, but can he understand the lessons his father, inspired by the Greek philosopher Socrates, is trying to teach him? This is a story of two nations, two teams, and a father and a son, the things that divide them and the things that unite us all. Set against the backdrop of the 1986 World Cup and the sociopolitical backgrounds of both nations - this is the story of the world's smallest footballing nation, taking on its best. With laughter and passion, this is the ultimate story of the beautiful game and what it means.",2014,"Comedy, Drama, Sport            ","John Hannah, Conleth Hill, Richard Dormer, Art Parkinson",James Erskine,211,,5.9

Two Down,92,"Two Down is the first theatrical feature from Fizz and Ginger Films, whom Screen International (UK), picked for their 'Stars of Tomorrow' edition in 2013. Set in modern day London, Two Down is nevertheless inspired by films of the 1970's, which gives this clever little thriller an interesting spin in the look, the dialogue and the sound. After surviving an explosion in Iraq, Mr. Thomas leaves the infuriating desk job the army had created for him and enters the underground world of the contract killer. His brother, Sam, had been caught selling on army secrets to the highest bidder and is now working for the illusive Harry Montagu. They use Mr. Thomas as a very effective way of eliminating problems they encounter in their business. That is until Mr. Thomas begins to question whom these problems are that he is removing, and why they deserve this fate. We start the film with Mr. Thomas following a target, a young woman. All is not as it seems as she manages to fight him off long enough for someone in the shadows to shoot him in the back. Thinking him dead they walk away, leaving him to die in the alleyway. Mr. Thomas, surviving, but injured, manages to get to a safe house owned by a friend. When he arrives however his friend is no longer there but a young woman, Sophie.

But when Max, now pushing 40, begins to grow lazy and indifferent in the performing of even these minor tasks, he is unceremoniously fired and cast adrift - quickly discovering that society has little demand for an aging ex-professional buddy. Too old to compete with the up-and-comers and totally lacking any tangible ""real world"" skills, Max teeters on the verge of total breakdown. Ultimately though, Max will find new life through the eyes of the cute and quirky Bailey (Caplan), an elementary school teacher whose compassion helps Max discover that there is a place for him in the real world after all.

Your imagination can take you anywhere you want to go, let you be anyone you want to be, and, if you're lucky, it'll even create your very own BiG BiG Friend! And that's just what happened to three young friends, Yuri, Lili and Matt. One day, not so long ago, Yuri was nervous about going to preschool for the first time. Was he going to make new friends? Was his teacher going to like him? What if he didn't know what to say? Just as he was imagining all these things, a big blue elephant named Golias popped out of nowhere and joined Yuri on the way. Yuri was always very shy, but somehow things were different with Golias. The silly elephant's big and bold personality complimented Yuri's quiet, thoughtful ways; the two seemed a perfect match. And with that, Yuri had found himself a BiG BiG Friend! At school, Yuri was surprised to learn that he wasn't the only one with a BiG BiG Friend... A little girl named Lili and a little boy named Matt both had BiG BiG Friends, too! Lili had Nessa, a tall pink giraffe, and Matt had Bongo, a bouncy green kangaroo.

The Taming of the Shrew,156,"The main action of The Taming of the Shrew takes place as a play within the play, performed for the benefit of a drunken tinker, Christopher Sly. Baptista Minola, a wealthy widower of Padua, has two daughters: the demure and popular Bianca and her sharp-tongued and ill-tempered older sister, Katherina. Bianca already has two suitors - Hortensio and Gremio - when a third, Lucentio, arrives on the scene. Baptista, however, has decreed that no one can marry Bianca until a husband has been found for Katherina. A solution presents itself when Hortensio's friend Petruchio arrives in town looking for a wife. After meeting Katherina, Petruchio is unperturbed by her insults and resolves to marry her, leaving the way clear for Hortensio (posing as a music teacher), Lucentio (posing as a literary tutor) and the hapless Gremio to continue their pursuit of Bianca, whom Baptista decides to bestow on the wealthiest of the three. An absurdly costumed Petruchio arrives late for his wedding and conducts himself outrageously throughout. Afterwards, instead of staying for the wedding banquet, he immediately carries the still-protesting Katherina off to his house in Verona. There he subjects her to a series of humiliations - having food prepared and then sending it away untouched, ordering fine clothes for her and then rejecting them in apparent rage - in a calculated strategy to break down her willful disposition. The success of his plan becomes apparent when, at a celebration following the secret marriage of Bianca and Lucentio, the reformed Katherina advises the other women present on the necessity of being a devoted and dutiful wife.",2016,Comedy            ,"Sarah Afful, Ben Carlson, Deborah Hay, Peter Hutt",Barry Avrich,17,,8.1

Of course, where one man sees the dead rising from the grave, another sees opportunity. Q had a plan: drive the robbery getaway van, deliver everyone to the safe house and get paid - a nice, simple, plan. Unfortunately, life is never really that simple, and to top it all off, this is the first time Q has been a getaway driver. He's coping pretty well though, considering; TONY (the guy who is 'in charge' of the job) is a murderous nut case, DANNY was shot and is now bleeding all over the money in the back of the van, the Sat-Nav has a mind of its own, there's a guy in the back living up to his name ""CRAZY STEVE"", the safe-house already has police at it, and this whole ""zombie thing"" seems to be quickly becoming more of a ""zombie apocalypse thing"". Luckily, TONY knows of another Safe House on the coast. Not so luckily, DANNY dies of natural-ish causes and then rises from the grave. Q and the others have to deal with a recently zombie-fied medieval re-enactment group, a football team that seem hell bent on eating their brains and the van running out of fuel. In their search for refuge and some diesel, TONY spots - of all things - a fortified windmill and the group awkwardly team up with a lovely young woman called CASSIE and her insane, but well armed GRANDMA. As TONY descends into deeper and deeper psychosis, he forces a last stand against a zombie horde, dies horribly and takes GRANDMA with him. Not bad for a night's work. Some men are born into shit-storms, some achieve shit-storms, and some have shit-storms thrust upon them. Q is up to his neck in this one and must now take charge of the group in order to save his own skin - not to mention the much more attractive skin of CASSIE. Finally reaching the coast, the new group must figure out a way off this crazy island - lack of sailing know-how and the walking dead notwithstanding. Just when things couldn't get any worse, one of them suffers an accident and lands Q with a dilemma. In the one hand he holds his own life and in the other the lives of the group.

That's the premise of She's Got and Plan and the 30 day journey of Isis Angelo, a female writer-director trying to 'make it' in Hollywood. When we meet Isis she is a down-on-her-luck director whose struggles with life, love and career have come to a head. The story opens with a frustrated Isis who is approaching middle age knows that her window of opportunity for Hollywood success is rapidly closing. She works regularly on random productions, making enough to pay the rent, buy lean cuisines, and keep her classic Mercedes with just enough gas in it to make it to the next pitch meeting. She's tired of the rat race, the hustle, and all of the empty shallow people that populate power positions in the industry. She is tired of looking for real love with men who don't understand her and fed up with LA traffic stuck in her car feeling sidelined by life. Isis longs for the success that attracted her to the industry but realizes she is clearly at the end of her rope. Faced with the question - When do you give up on your dreams? Isis is forced to 'make something happen' and she takes all the money she has - including the rent money - and gives herself, her life, and her career 30 days to ""make it"" in Hollywood. The ensuing stress, drama, and hilarity derived from this self imposed deadline, develops as we follow Isis's days on the calendar, and her confessional video diary that she creates to document her final struggle. We are taken from counseling sessions with her truly ghetto friend to hilarious two bit reality shows, seedy production houses, horny execs, and the ever alluring Hollywood night life to a relationship with a ""dream Kodak"" boyfriend who of course is a dud. This comedic action enhanced by appearances of many recognizable members of black Hollywood is inter cut with serious, emotional scenes of Isis reflecting on her daily life, dealing with the worries and aspirations of her mother, and attempting to remain a real human being in a business increasingly filled with fake characters. Isis gets her big break when her heartfelt break up with her ""Kodak"" boyfriend is caught on a camera phone, posted to the internet and goes viral. However this is not the success she wants but instead of being defeated she finally deals with fears, her struggles and takes a leap of faith and moves beyond all the drama and her own deadline. Isis' story and character allows us form an intimate bond with her, which makes it easy to root for our heroine early on, even if we can't identify with her race or gender. The emotional connection we have with the main character only makes the odd situations and characters she runs across that much funnier. This emotional, comedic film, full of archetypes and actors that the entire country is familiar with is sure to tug the heart strings, and tickle the funny bone of audiences worldwide.",2016,Comedy            ,"Golden Brooks, Tsai Chin, Ja'net DuBois, Eliot","Fatima Washington, Corey Johnson",14,,5.1

He frantically tries to grab everything he can before his girlfriend, Tiffany (Giana Alexis Cambria) now probably retitled ""ex"" finds him, but he's too late. Catching him off guard, she confesses that the obstacles in their relationship are actually her fault. As forgiveness, and to his surprise, she even offers him his secret fantasy; a threesome with his mistress. But none of this would have transpired if Tiffany had never befriended Angelica (Morgan Filteau) at a restaurant that the couple usually frequented. During a conversation, the two girls find common ground regarding their significant others and realize they're both dating the same guy. The two ladies thus devise a ploy to expose Nick's obscenity with a website dedicated to him. All they need are a few embarrassing pictures, but something is wrong and Nick soon dies. The decision becomes clear to rid the evidence before anyone can make a connection. On the way to dispose the body -- wherever that may be -- they'll question their sexuality and ask themselves; would you have a threesome to make your partner happy?",2014,"Comedy, Drama, Horror            ","Frank Bachant, Diana Bernal, Paul Boos, Giana Alexis Cambria",Jason Morillo,28,,3.9

Only a few years older than Camila's own son, Nate is the newly promoted Chief Intern who's been taken under the wing of the brilliant and ultra-cool Medical Director, Dr. Owen Sieber (Richard Ruccolo). Except for daily abuse from his work enemy, the tough as nails Tracey Wiggins, RN (Carla Jimenez) Nate enjoys leading misfit medics struggling to survive in the hospital's training program. But, the unexpected arrival of Andrew (Jim Beaver) inadvertently reveals a dark secret which threatens to destroy Nate's future at Portland Memorial Hospital. As we mentioned, Nate is prone to imagining himself in fantasy sequences involving recreated scenes with actors from classic TV shows he grew up watching. So, each week will bring cameos from some new (old) favorites. Good times!",2016,Comedy            ,"Joey Adams, Michael Dorn, Phyllis Ramie Groves, Carla Jimenez",,0,,0.0

Tiny Plastic Men,22,"Gottfried Bros Toy & Train Co. makes everything from video games to board games, from toy cars to action figures. These toys need to be tested, and those tests are carried out by the lowest rung of the company, the Prototype Department. Working in an office that looks more like a decked-out, nerdy frat house, Crad, Addison, and October test toy and game prototypes for quality, danger and defect. But most of their time is actually spent dealing with bizarre office politics, oddball guests, and their own imaginations. Sitcom adventures ensue, punctuated by off-the-wall live action and animated sketches. Team-leader Crad has some anger management issues, but he's fiercely loyal to his two buddies, and he tries hard to be a good father to his sarcastic, wiser-than-her-years daughter, Susie. Addison is the not-so-bright, but positive and fun-loving guy with a zest for life and an aversion to his ADD medication. And then there's October, a deadpan, well-educated, Edward-Scissorhands-meets-Spock, steam punk enthusiast, living in his own dark little universe. The trio are in nerd heaven, drinking and doing drugs on the job while playing with toys all day but they're easily distracted and impossible to keep on task, not to mention they are constantly thwarted by zany obstacles. Jesse, a corporate-climbing middle management game designer, thinks he's in charge of the Prototypes Department, and is always trying to steal any profitable toy and game ideas. Alexandra, the lustful man-eating boss, is more than willing to abuse her power with her underlings and routinely threatens everyone's jobs. Alexandra's father and the doddering founder, Mr. Gottfried, wanders the company's halls, often making crazy demands for toy designs which the guys must bend over backwards to accommodate. And then there are the Video Game Testers (aka ""VGT's""), the other nerdy trio and arch-rivals of the Prototypes, prank the three men and set them up for failure. Numerous guest toy designers, spokespeople, long-lost relatives and other odd folks round out the cast of characters who succeed at making life extra complicated for our heroes. The show's variety of live action and animated comedy sketches spring from the guys' daydreams, their off-color discussions, the toys and games that they test and collect, and moments in the characters' somewhat warped minds.",2012,Comedy            ,"Chris Craddock, Matt Alden, Mark Meer, Belinda Cornish",,144,,5.1
